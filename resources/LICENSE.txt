LZ4 license clause
=============================================================================

This repository uses 2 different licenses :
- all files in the `lib` directory use a BSD 2-Clause license
- all other files use a GPLv2 license, unless explicitly stated otherwise

Relevant license is reminded at the top of each source file,
and with the presence of COPYING or LICENSE file.

This model emphasizes the fact that
only files in the `lib` directory are designed to be included into 3rd party projects.

Other files, such as those from `programs` or `examples` directory,
are not intended to be compiled outside of their context.
They can serve as source of inspiration,
but they should not be copy/pasted into 3rd party projects,
as this scenario is not supported.
